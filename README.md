###  Game Concept
SlimeRunner is a 1-bit platformer game created as a university project. In this game, the player controls a small slime character that runs and jumps through different platform challenges.

The main goal is to collect gems while avoiding traps and dangerous obstacles. Each level has different platform layouts, requiring careful timing and movement. Since the game uses a 1-bit black and white style, it focuses on clear shapes and strong contrast to create a simple but clean visual look.
